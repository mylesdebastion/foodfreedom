## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Base:**

2. **Add Vegan Chicken:**
   - Add the vegan shredded chicken to the pan and cook for a few minutes, stirring frequently.

3. **Add Spices:**
   - Stir in coriander, cumin, turmeric, garam masala, chili powder, cardamom, salt, and pepper. Cook for a couple of minutes.

4. **Add Creaminess:**
   - Pour in the coconut milk, and add the vegan yogurt and ground almonds or cashew paste. Stir well.

5. **Simmer:**
   - Reduce the heat and simmer for 20-30 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and flavors are well combined.

6. **Garnish and Serve:**
   - Garnish with chopped cilantro.
   - Serve with cooked rice or naan bread.
